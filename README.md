The notebook covers the basics of NumPy (creating, indexing and slicing arrays); datatypes; array copy vs. array view; array shapes and reshaping; iterating through arrays; joining and splitting arrays; searching, sorting and filtering arrays. 

### 2. [Matplotlib: An Introduction](https://github.com/shirshod/matplotlib_viz):
The notebook covers basics of plotting (lines, points); manipulating markers, styles and labels; adding grids; subplots; scatterplots; bar charts; histograms; pie charts.

### 3. [Altair: An Introduction](https://github.com/shirshod/altair_viz):
The notebooks cover plotting simple and compound charts; binning and aggregation; adding interactivities; data transformations during chart creation; configuring charts; geographic plots. 

### 4. [Text Analysis: An Introduction](https://github.com/shirshod/text_analysis_basics):
The notebook covers simple word analysis (Python Counter and CountVectorizer); advanced word analysis (stemmers, Term Frequency â€” Inverse Document Frequency, documents and text clustering, n-grams and multiword phrases); sentiment analysis using Natural Language Toolkit, TextBlob and NRC Emotion Lexicon; designing own machine-learning sentiment analysis programs using vectorizers and Scikitlearn (logistic regression, random forests, linear SVC, Multinomial naive Bayes methods); topic modeling (Non-Negative Matrix Factorization/Latent Semantic Indexing and Latent Dirichlet Allocation methods); optimizing topic models using GridSearchCV; deploying NMF/LSI and LDA models using Gensim; visualizing LDA model using PyLDAvis; introduction to word embeddings and Named Entity Recognition using SpaCy; conceptual document similarity using Cosine Similarity; comparing documents in different languages (Universal Sentence Encoding and Tensorflow); converting documents/images to text (Tesseract and Tika).
